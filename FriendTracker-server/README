This is your new Play 2.1 application
=====================================

This file will be packaged with your application, when using `play dist`.

Current Version: Server part: filter works, SetVisibility works(didnt test Redis, but tested by updating Database)
SetVisibility uses the same request as locationUpdate, every time change on visibility will push the current location+visibility to 
Redis.

updatelocation() now updates both Redis and Cache.
timeout saves from cache to db when user is kicked out of cache. But renew the timer doesnt work so far.--11:22 pm March 20

Server handles timeout correctly, kick user out of cache as well as session key.
